# desk-control

This is a simple physical widget that sits on your desk and allows you to perform some basic productivity tasks. It works independently of your computer or phone and hence, _in theory_, it should help you focus on your work. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features as I go along.

## Features

- **Current Time** - Displays the current time in a 24-hour format.
- **Weather** - Displays the current temperature, wind, and weather condition (sunny, cloudy, etc.) for a given location.
- **Pomodoro Timer** - A simple timer that helps you focus on your work for a some template amount of time and then take a break. Current implementation is 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break. You can change this in the code.
- **Calendar** - Displays the current date and the next 2 events from your Google Calendar. You need to set up a Google script to get the events from your calendar. See the [Google Calendar Setup](#google-calendar-setup) section below.

## Planned Features

- **Spotify Control** - Control your Spotify playback (play, pause, next, previous) from the widget.
- **Todoist Integration** - View and complete your upcoming tasks from Todoist.

## Hardware Setup (Work in Progress)

The hardware setup is a work in progress. I will be updating this section as I go along. Currently, the hardware setup is:

- **Microcontroller** - ESP32-DevKitC-v4
- **Display** - 2.4" TFT LCD (ILI9341) with SPI interface
- **Rotary Encoder** - KY-040 rotary encoder with push button.

Pin definitions are given in [here](/main/pin_definitions.h).

## Software Setup

ESP IDF is used to program the ESP32. The project can be configured using `idf.py menuconfig`. The following configuration options are most relevant:

- **ESP_WIFI_SSID** - The SSID of the Wi-Fi network to connect to.
- **ESP_WIFI_PASSWORD** - The password of the Wi-Fi network to connect to.
- **CALENDAR_URL** - The URL of the Google script that returns the events from your calendar.

## Mock UI

The mock UI is a simple representation of what the final UI will look like. It is not a final design and will be updated as I go along. The current design is a simple grid layout with a monotype font which makes absolute positioning of the elements easy.

## Progress

The project is being prototyped on a breadboard and the hardware setup is a work in progress. The software is being developed in parallel. The current status of the project is shown below:

## Google Calendar Setup

To get the events from your Google Calendar, you need to set up a Google script that will fetch the events and return them in a JSON format. The script should be deployed as a web app and the URL should be added to the code. The following steps will help you set up the Google script:

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Copy and paste the code from this (file)[https://github.com/mubarizahmed/desk_control/blob/main/other/calendar.gs] into the script editor
3. Save the project and give it a name.
4. Click on the `Deploy` button and select `New deployment`.
5. Select `Web app` and give it a name.
6. Select `Anyone` under `Who has access` and click on `Deploy`.
7. Authorize the script to access your Google Calendar.
8. Copy the URL of the web app and paste it in the code where it says `CALENDAR_URL`.
9. Save the code and run the script to test it. You should see the events from your calendar in the JSON format.

Thanks to this [blog post](https://www.instructables.com/E-Ink-Family-Calendar-Using-ESP32/) for the idea and the code to get the events from the Google Calendar. The code has been modified to fit the needs of this project.
